Bubble Bath
===========
make your life easier

save your ivy report for buildA to buildA.html
save your ivy report for buildB to buildB.html

ruby check.rb buildA.html
ruby check.rb buildB.html

ruby compare_hash.rb buildA.html.yml buildB.html.yml

Then you will see what dependencies have changed between buildA and buildB.

If this doesn't help you, go take a real bubble bath
